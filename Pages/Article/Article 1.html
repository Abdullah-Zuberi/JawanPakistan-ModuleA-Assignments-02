    <h1 id="lion-heading">Lion</h1>
    <p>
      The lion is known as the "King of the Jungle" and is one of the most
      iconic big cats. They live in prides and are known for their social
      behavior. Lions are primarily nocturnal hunters and can roar loudly to
      communicate with each other. Lions are also known for their powerful
      physique, with males having impressive manes that vary in color from light
      blonde to dark brown. These manes are a symbol of their strength and
      dominance within the pride.

    <h1 id="dolphin-heading">Dolphin</h1>
    <p>
      Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals known for their playful
      nature. They are excellent swimmers and use echolocation to communicate
      and locate prey. Dolphins also have a complex social structure and
      communicate through a series of clicks and whistles. Their remarkable
      intelligence allows them to solve problems, and they have even been known
      to help humans at sea. Dolphins' friendly and curious behavior makes them
      a beloved species in the oceans.

    <h1 id="elephant-heading">Elephant</h1>
    <p>
      Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They have a remarkable
      memory and form strong family bonds within their herds. Elephants are
      herbivores and have a significant impact on their ecosystems. They also
      have a unique trunk that serves various purposes, including feeding,
      drinking, and communication. The ivory tusks of elephants, unfortunately,
      make them targets for illegal poaching, threatening their survival. Many
      conservation efforts are in place to protect these magnificent creatures
      and their habitats.

    <h1 id="penguin-heading">Penguin</h1>
    <p>
      Penguins are flightless birds that are perfectly adapted to life in the
      water. They are known for their distinctive black and white plumage and
      their ability to "fly" underwater while hunting for fish. Penguins also
      have a strong sense of community and often huddle together to stay warm in
      cold climates. These social birds are found primarily in the Southern
      Hemisphere, with some species inhabiting the freezing waters of
      Antarctica.

    <h1 id="octopus-heading">Octopus</h1>
    <p>
      Octopuses are highly intelligent and elusive creatures of the ocean. They
      have the ability to change color and texture to camouflage themselves and
      are known for their complex problem-solving skills. Octopuses have three
      hearts and can squirt ink as a defense mechanism to escape from predators.
      Some species of octopuses are masters of disguise, blending seamlessly
      into their surroundings. These intriguing creatures continue to fascinate
      scientists and marine enthusiasts alike.
